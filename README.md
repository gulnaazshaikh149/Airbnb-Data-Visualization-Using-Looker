# Airbnb-Data-Visualization-Using-Looker
Airbnb has revolutionized the hospitality industry, enabling individuals to earn from renting out their properties, ranging from homes and flats to unique accommodations like treehouses and houseboats. Often dubbed the "Uber of housing," Airbnb's platform facilitates hosts in listing their properties while allowing guests to search and book accommodations based on location, availability, and pricing. By offering diverse, personalized, and cost-effective lodging options, Airbnb has disrupted the conventional hotel sector, providing a secondary income source for hosts and more tailored choices for guests. 

However, despite its success, there's a need to enhance performance areas within Airbnb, which traditional methods fail to pinpoint. Leveraging data visualization can uncover crucial insights, patterns, and trends that raw data alone cannot reveal, allowing for better-informed improvements and strategic focus.

Businesses can utilize dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) like reviews, rates, and occupancy, facilitating real-time tracking of progress and goals. Dashboards play a pivotal role in identifying areas needing attention and where performance lacks.

The objective of this project is to craft a data visualization dashboard for Airbnb, offering actionable insights to enhance decision-making and overall business performance. The goal is to empower business owners with data-driven insights to drive better decisions and improve Airbnb's operational efficiency.

The "Average Availability by Neighborhood Group & Room Type" metric in Airbnb analytics denotes the average number of days a specific room type in a neighborhood group is available for booking. Queens shows higher availability than Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Staten Island. This helps identify high-demand areas and popular room types with high occupancy rates. For instance, high availability for hotel rooms in Queens may suggest lower demand, prompting pricing or marketing adjustments. Conversely, limited availability for entire home/apt in Queens signifies high demand, suggesting potential revenue maximization through adjusted pricing strategies during peak seasons.

Analyzing NYC data shows Manhattan with the most reviews, followed by Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island.

Allowing pets can expand the guest pool, raise rates, and lead to better reviews. Permitting parties might increase rates, drive repeat business, and generate positive reviews. Allowing smoking can raise rates, foster repeat bookings, and reduce competition, but moderation is key to balancing potential drawbacks. Implementing controlled house rules, like designated smoking areas and limited noise for parties, could offer benefits while managing downsides. 

Investing in an Airbnb with a flexible cancellation policy can significantly benefit hosts, leading to increased revenue and better guest satisfaction. A flexible policy tends to attract more bookings, boosts occupancy rates, and encourages positive reviews. Guests favor hosts with flexible policies, resulting in more repeat bookings and a competitive edge in a saturated market. Ultimately, offering flexibility can set hosts apart, attracting more bookings and driving revenue growth.
